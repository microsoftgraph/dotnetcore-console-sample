# dotnetcore-console-sample

This repository will contain several samples showing how to interact with Microsoft Graph using the .Net core SDK.  
These samples have been created as part of the [30 days of Microsoft Graph](https://aka.ms/30DaysMSGraph) blog series.
Each of the samples builds from a common base project, in order to sucessfully build a sample you must first complete the setup required in the base project for that application type.
