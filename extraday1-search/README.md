# Extra Day 1 - Use the Microsoft Search API to query data

This sample was added after the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph blog series and as such has limited documentation.  The key points to note:

- Permissions required
  - Delegated (work or school account)
    - Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite, Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All, ExternalItem.Read.All
- appsettings.json
  - Specify the query keyword to search against in addition to standard configuration values.
