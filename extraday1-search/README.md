This sample was added after the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph blog series and as such has limited documentation.  The key points to note:

- Permissions required
  - Delegated (work or school account)
    - Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite, Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All, ExternalItem.Read.All
- appsettings.json
  - Specify the query keyword to search against in addition to standard configuration values.
